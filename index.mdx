## Rate limits

You can make up to 50 API requests per second! CreatorDB's API server uses load balancing and auto-scaling mechanisms to delegate requests to different machines, allowing a large volume of API calls without sacrificing speed and bandwidth. Just make sure you have purchased enough API credits to make bulk requests.
